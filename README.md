## Core Gameplay Mechanics
- **Choice-Driven Narrative:** Players progress by making decisions (e.g., "Go left" or "Talk to the wizard"), which branch the story.
- **Inventory System:** Collect items (keys, weapons, spells) to solve puzzles or unlock paths.
- **Stat Tracking:** Track stats like health, stamina, charisma, or magic to influence outcomes (e.g., persuading NPCs or surviving combat).
- **Puzzles:** Integrate riddles, environmental challenges, or item combinations (e.g., "Use the rusty key on the old chest").
- **Combat:** Turn-based or action-driven (e.g., "Attack with sword" or "Cast fireball").

## AI use
- use of AI agents for creating and keeping track of the storyline.
